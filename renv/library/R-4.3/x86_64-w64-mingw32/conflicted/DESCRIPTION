Title: An Alternative Conflict Resolution Strategy

Description: R's default conflict management system gives the most
    recently loaded package precedence. This can make it hard to detect
    conflicts, particularly when they arise because a package update
    creates ambiguity that did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes a
    different approach, making every conflict an error and forcing you to
    choose which function to use.
